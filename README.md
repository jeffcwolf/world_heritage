This is a Ruby program that allows the user (a 'Traveler') to explore basic data about World Heritage sites.

The traveler has a number of different search options:

-Search by World Heritage site name directly, if known (1007 in total)<br>
-Search by country name (186 in total)<br>
-Search by world region name (5 in total)<br>
-Search by site category ('cultural', 'natural' or 'mixed')<br>
-Search by keyword in the text of site descriptions<br>

The traveler can also find a random site or generate a random itinerary (a collection of random sites) of a chosen size.

Search results can be saved to a YAML file for later review.
